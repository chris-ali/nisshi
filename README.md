# Nisshi
A simple logbook application for pilots to log flights. Allows for a unified location for simulated and real flights to be logged.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6. and .NET Core 5.0

Implements Swagger endpoints, CQRS pattern via MediatR and JWT authentication 

## Development server

To run with the .NET WebAPI backend, run `dotnet build && dotnet run` from the project root folder, then open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001/`. Swagger endpoints are accessible by appending `swagger` to that URL   

The app will open in your default browser, and then automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the Angular unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
